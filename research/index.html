	<p> My research focuses on Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and their impact on planetary systems. 
    	CMEs are huge eruptions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun that occur on a daily basis and that can travel all the way to the Earth, 
    	leading to strong geomagnetic storms that ultimately leads to auroral phenomena but can also cause significant disruptions to satellites, 
    	telecommunication systems and power gridlines. </p>
  
  	<p>In my research, I use a new solar wind and heliospheric model, <a href="https://euhforia.com">EUHFORIA</a>, 
	to model magnetised CMEs from the Sun to the Earth, with the aim of improving predictions of the CME properties at Earth 
	as well as their final impact on geospace. 
	Apart from this modelling part, I also work a lot with solar observations of CMEs and their source regions 
	to study how to translate observations into an optimal set of CME parameters eventually used to drive prediction models.
