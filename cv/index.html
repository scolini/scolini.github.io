	<h1>Short Bio:</h1>
	
	<p>I am currently a NASA Jack Eddy Postdoctoral Fellow at the Space Science Center at the University of New Hampshire (USA), 
		where I work in Prof. Réka Winslow’s research group. My current research investigates the interplanetary propagation of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
		and how their internal structure responds to interactions with different solar wind transients and other CMEs. 
		I conduct my research using a combination of remote-sensing and in-situ observations, complemented by numerical simulations of the inner heliosphere.</p> 
		
		<p> In May 2020, I received a PhD in Mathematics from KU Leuven (Belgium), 
		where I worked with Prof. Stefaan Poedts and Dr. Luciano Rodriguez from the Royal Observatory of Belgium. 
		In my PhD research project, I investigated the role of magnetic fields in determining the ultimate space weather impact of CMEs 
		throughout the heliosphere using the new EUHFORIA solar wind and CME propagation model. </p>
		
		<p>I hold a BSc (2014) and MSc (2016) in Physics from the University of Trieste, where I was a student of Prof. Mauro Messerotti.</p>
