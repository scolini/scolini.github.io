	<h1>Hi there, I'm Camilla Scolini!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my personal homepage! 
		I am a NASA Jack Eddy postdoctoral fellow 
		at the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space 
		at the University of New Hampshire. 
		My research focuses on solar eruptions, 
		particularly Coronal Mass Ejections and the study of their “effectiveness” 
		– their ability to affect planetary systems in different ways.</p>
